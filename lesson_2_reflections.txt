when you initialize a repository git adds a .git file to the directory. This is necessary because this file keeps track of all commits made.
the staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it is a temporary hold for files that have changed. This is valuable because this lets you only commit only what you need to, and make sure what you are commiting before doing so.
